## App name
**EcoQuiz - Home Edition**

## App description
Our solution tackles the problem in a **_creative_** and **_fun_** way, aiming to deliver a product that would be both **useful** as a solution to the main problem and **fun to use** by the customer.
It allows users to send in pictures instead of inputing numbers, _where this can be done_. The user would input info about the flooring, walls, windows, etc. through **gamified functionalities** in the app. 
Each completed question gives to the user **reward points**, and each completed section gives them **badges**.
The reward points at the end of the survey are tigthly tied to how much energy the user would save by choosing to renovate the home with all the proposed solutions.
We choose to allow users to send partial data too, in order to not scare them. 
This way, if an user can answer	simple questions (like windows type and count) but has issues with some more technical ones (like walls insulation type, etc.), they can simply decide to skip the question or the hole section or again to upload only photos.
The data package will then be sent directly to suppliers/advisors for a first accurate review of that specific situation (remotely. That makes it faster and user friendly. Based on the first evaluation, the supplier / advisor will give feedback and / or ask forsome other details.

### Bonus features
* Automatic AI based image recognition for windows type (single pane, double pane, etc.)
* Automatic AI based windows counting from uploaded image
* AR plugin to show a preview of the final result (useful from a sales point of view)
