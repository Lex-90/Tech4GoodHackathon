<app description>
	Our solution tackles the problem in a creative and fun way, aiming to deliver 
	a product that would be both useful as a solution to the main problem and fun 
	to use by the customer.
	Our solution allows users to send in pictures instead of inputing numbers, 
	where this can be done. The user would input info about the flooring, walls, 
	windows, etc. through gamified functionalities in the app. 
	Each completed question gives to the user reward points, and each completed 
	section gives them badges.
	The reward points at the end of the survey are tighly tied on how much energy
	the user would save by choosing	to renovate the home with all the proposed 
	solutions.
	We choose to allow users to send partial data too, in order to not scare them. 
	This way, if an user can answer	simple questions (like windows type and count) 
	but has issues with some more technical ones (like walls insulation type, etc.), 
	they can simply decide to skip the question or the hole section or again to 
	upload only photos.
	The data package will then be sent directly to suppliers/advisors for a first 
	accurate review of that specific situation (remotely). That makes it faster and 
	user friendly. Based on the first evaluation, the supplier / advisor will give
	feedback and / or ask for some other details.
